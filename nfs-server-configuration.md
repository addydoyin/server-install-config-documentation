 NFS Server Installation Documentation
  ===


 A. Introduction
 ---

 1. Purpose

The NFS (Network File System) server allows seamless sharing of files and directories among Linux and Unix-like systems. This documentation provides a guide through the installation, configuration, and maintenance of an NFS server on an Ubuntu system.


 2. Integration with Linux Server

NFS is integrated into the Linux server environment to enable efficient and transparent sharing of files and resources among networked systems.


 B. Installation and Configuration
---

 1. NFS Server Installation

+ To install the NFS server on Ubuntu:


sudo apt update
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server

+ Check and enable nfs:

sudo systemcl status nfs-kernel-server
sudo systemctl start nfs-kernel-server / sudo systemctl enable nfs-kernel-server

+ Create the directory to contain the resources to be shared and a backup directory:

sudo mkdir -p /exports/sharesDocs /exports/backup

+ Ensure proper permissions: Make /exports/ directory rwx for all

sudo chmood -R 777 /exports/

+ Edit the /etc/exports file to define shared directories, permissions, and access controls:

/exports/backup		clientip (permissions)
/exports/sharedDocs	clientip (permissions)
permissions include: (rw,ro,sync,async,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash,root_squash)


 2. NFS Client Installation

+ To install NFS server on Ubuntu:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nfs-common

+ Create directories to mount on in the mnt directory:

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs/backup /mnt/nfs/sharedDocs

+ Confirm server configuration:

showmount ––exports serverip


 C. Integration with Linux Users
===

NFS integrates seamlessly with Linux users, utilizing existing user accounts for access control.


 D. Security and Access Controls
===

 1. Firewall Configuration

Configure the firewall to allow NFS traffic

sudo ufw allow nfs

 2. Encryption and Authentication

NFS primarily relies on host-based security. Ensure proper network security measures are in place, and consider using SSH for additional encryption if needed.


 E. Testing and Verification
===

 1. Access Testing

+ Mounting shared directories from client machines:

sudo mount serverip:/server/mount/point /client/mount/point

e.g: sudo mount 192.168.8.10:/exports/sharedDocs /mnt/nfs/sharedDocs

+ Confirm mount:

df -h

+ TO configure mount from boot in the /etc/fstab file:

serverip:/server/mount/point /client/mount/point function file-type defaults 0 0

e.g: 192.168.8.10:/exports/backup /mnt/nfs/backup backup nfs defaults 0 0

 2. Error Handling

Refer to system logs (/var/log/syslog) for error messages and resolve issues based on error codes and descriptions.


 F. Maintenance and Upgrades
===

 1. Software Updates

Keep the NFS server up-to-date by regularly applying system updates:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade nfs-kernel-server

 2. Monitoring NFS

Monitor server performance with tools like `nfsstat`. Keep an eye on server load, file access patterns, and potential bottlenecks.


 G. Troubleshooting
===

 1. Logs and Diagnostics

Access system logs (/var/log/syslog) and NFS-specific logs (/var/log/nfs*) for diagnostics.

 2. Common NFS Issues

Common issues are related to NFS functionality, including mount failures, permission errors, and connectivity problems.

 H. Conclusion
===

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide through the installation, configuration, and maintenance of an NFS (Network File System) server on Ubuntu, emphasizing seamless file sharing among Linux systems, integration with Linux servers, proper installation steps, firewall configuration, encryption considerations, user integration, access testing, error handling, ongoing maintenance through software updates, and monitoring server performance, highlighting the significance of continuous monitoring, maintenance, and user training for a successful NFS server setup while adapting to evolving requirements and security standards.

1. User Accounts
+ Create user samba users
sudo useradd -s sbin/nologin tech
sudo useradd -s sbin/nologin finance
sudo useradd -s sbin/nologin admin

+ Assign password
sudo smb passwd -a tech
sudo smb passwd -a finance
sudo smb passwd -a admin


 2. Integration with Linux Users

Samba users can be synchronized with Linux users, ensuring consistency across the system. Also, samba users are not alowed login privilege toit the host


 D. Security and Access Controls
 ---

 1. Firewall Configuration

sudo ufw allow Samba

 2. Encryption and Authentication
    
Enable encryption in the smb.conf file and enforce user-level security.

 E. Testing and Verification
 ---

 1. Access Testing

Test file and print services by accessing the Samba share from both Windows and Linux clients.
$ testparm
	Output:.............
	
	Check if smbd is up and running:
		$ systemctl status smdb
	Expeted output:...........
	
	
	2. If output is ...........
		$ systemctl start smdb / $ systemctl enable smdb
		
	Check if nmbd is up and running:
		$ systemctl status nmdb
	Expected output:..............
	If output is ...........
		$ systemctl start nmdb / $ systemctl enable nmdb

+ Verify on windows by typing the following in the command line:
\\hostipadressserverip
e.g: \\192.168.8.10

+ verify on linux by typing the following in the text corner of the files:
smb://serverip
e.g: smb//:192.168.8.10

 2. Common Samba Issues

Offer solutions to common issues related to Samba functionality to expedite problem resolution.

 H. Integration with Other Services
 ---

 1. LDAP or Active Directory Integration

If applicable, document the integration of Samba with LDAP or Active Directory for a centralized user management system.

I. Conclusion
